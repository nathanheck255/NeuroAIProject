# NeuroAI Project

We will be entering the Algonauts competition. This is our repository for creating a model to learn the brain activity that occurs when people are presented with images of natural scenes.

## TO-DO

- [X] Decide on model architectures
- [X] Train model(s)
- [X] Write final report
- [X] Submit results
